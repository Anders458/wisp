+ Anvil is an extremely high-performance Entity-Component-System (ECS) engine written in typescript.

+ Always be brutally honest when asked for recommendations. Think outside the box.

+ All public APIs are designed to be maximally terse and ergonomic.

+ All APIs follow test-first design. We write the usage and expected inputs and outputs before any implementation.

+ Always follow existing coding standards and choose idiomatic naming conventions based on what is already in the project. 

+ Assume all code in the project has been human approved.

+ Always take the time to suggest and factor out modules that can be generalized such as data structures.

+ Always add methods in alphabetical order to classes.

+ Create illustrations to depict what you are suggesting or explaining.

+ Always put a space before opening parenthesis and opening square brackets.
